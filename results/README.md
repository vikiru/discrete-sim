|    1     |                   [Original Policy](/results/original_policy/)                    | The original operating policy of the manufacturing facility. Follows a FIFO approach along with priority scheduling. |
|    2     |   [Random Policy, Equal Probability](/results/random_policy_equal_probability/)   |         An alternative operating policy where every workstation has an equal chance of getting component C1.         |
|    3     | [Random Policy, Less Probability W1](/results/random_policy_less_probability_w1/) |                 An alternative operating policy where W1 has a lower chance of getting component C1.                 |
|    4     | [Random Policy, More Probability W1](/results/random_policy_more_probability_w1/) |                An alternative operating policy where W1 has a higher chance of getting component C1.                 |
|    5     |                   [Reverse Priority](/results/reverse_priority)                   |                     An alternative operating policy with reverse priority order (W3 > W2 > W1).                      |
