|     2    	|   [Random Policy, Equal Probability](https://github.com/vikiru/discrete-sim/tree/add-readme/results/random_policy_equal_probability)   	|         An alternative operating policy where every workstation has an equal chance of getting component C1.         	|
|     3    	| [Random Policy, Less Probability W1](https://github.com/vikiru/discrete-sim/tree/add-readme/results/random_policy_less_probability_w1) 	|                 An alternative operating policy where W1 has a lower chance of getting component C1.                 	|
|     4    	| [Random Policy, More Probability W1](https://github.com/vikiru/discrete-sim/tree/add-readme/results/random_policy_more_probability_w1) 	|                 An alternative operating policy where W1 has a higher chance of getting component C1.                	|
|     5    	|                   [Reverse Priority](https://github.com/vikiru/discrete-sim/tree/add-readme/results/reverse_priority)                  	|                      An alternative operating policy with reverse priority order (W3 > W2 > W1).                     	|
