# Alternate Simulator

<p align="justify">
The alternate simulator makes use of the [simulator](simulator.md) to run the original operating policy followed by the four alternative policies in succession.

The difference is that the simulation time is changed to t = 50000 from t = 10000 and each operating policy is run 10 times. The results of these simulations are stored within the results folder with sub-folders separating the results of each simulation run for each policy.
